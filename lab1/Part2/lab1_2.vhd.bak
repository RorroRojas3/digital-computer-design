-- Purpose: Create a Ripple-Carry Adder with four Full Adders
-- Board: DE1_SoC

USE ieee.std_logic_1164.ALL;

-- ENTITY for a Ripple Carry Adder called "FourBitFullAdder" which contains input called "SW" which is
-- a 10 bit input which will be assigned pins Sw9-SW0 of the board to enter
-- two four bit numbers. It also contains 15 outputs. Outputs Cout, S3, S2, S1
-- and S0 are one bit outputs which as a whole will contain the sum of the two
-- four bit numbers entered. The other 10 outputs correspond to "SWLEDS" which will
-- be assigned to LEDS9-0 on the board with the purpose to display the two numbers entered in binary
-- as well as displaying the sum of both numbers in binary. 
ENTITY lab1_2 IS
	PORT (SW: IN std_logic_vector(9 DOWNTO 0);
			SWLEDS: OUT std_logic_vector(9 DOWNTO 0)
			);

-- ARCHITECTURE of the Ripple-Carry Adder is composed of COMPONENT
-- FullAdder which contains three inputs and two outputs. The three inputs
-- are three different bit numbers of value 0 or 1 which will be added
-- based on Boolean Logic. The two outputs consists of two bit numbers of value
-- 0 or 1. The outputs Cout and Sum will display the sum of the three inputs. 
-- SIGNALS Carry0, Carry1, and Carry1, will be used to store the outputs
-- of different additions and outputs tempCout, tempS3-S0, will be used 
-- to store the final sum of two four bit binary numbers. The Ripple-Carry Adder
-- will contain four Full Adders which will calculate the sum of the two four bit
-- binary inputs and will display the sum if desired.
