-- Purpose: Perform Binary-to-Decimal number conversion and display it in a 7-Segment Display
-- Board: DE1_SoC 5CSEMA5F31C6

-- Entity of a Binary to Decimal is declared with one input of four bits which
-- will be connected to pins SW3-SW0 on the board and two outputs of five bits
-- which will be connected to two 7-Segment Displays of the board, HEX1, and HEX0 
ENTITY Lab1a IS PORT
(
	V:	IN std_logic_vector(3 DOWNTO 0);
	HEX1, HEX0: OUT std_logic_vector(6 DOWNTO 0)
);
END Lab1a;


-- Architecture of a Binary-To-Decimal converter which is composed of component 
-- "sevenSegmentDisplay" which is responsible to display the conversion from 
-- binary to decimal based on Truth Table. The purpose of the architecture is 
-- to calculate the Boolean Logic of the conversion by using Truth Table and 
-- creating Kornough Maps based on them. Then, the result will be stored on a SIGNAL
-- called "BCDConversion". Finally, the SIGNAL "BCDConversion" will be mapped to the 
-- COMPONENT "DISPLAY" which corresponds to the "sevenSegmentDisplay" component and will
-- PORT MAP it will map the corresponding input and output which then will be displayed on
-- 7-Segment Display Hex1 and Hex0 of the board.
