Here you will find your entire assignment.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!DO NOT EDIT THE FOLDER STRUCTURE UNLESS OTHERWISE TOLD TO DO SO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

When finished editing, you need only type "make" in the device and aocl_traffic folders to compile the code.  Keep in mind YOU MUST BE ON A ULLAB COMPUTER for compilation to succeed (we will not help you install the AOCL utilities on your own computer, the process is very complicated).  This will generate the.aocx file you need.

Refer to the Compilation and Usage Instructions document for information about setting up the FPGA for OpenCL and Copying files to your SD card.
